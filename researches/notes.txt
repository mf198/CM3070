    • An Adversary Model of Fraudsters’ Behavior to Improve Oversampling in Credit Card Fraud Detection
“Algorithm-level techniques address the problem by modifying the classifiers to guarantee robust accuracy concerning data imbalance. This includes adjusting the cost matrix to increase the importance of misclassified samples from the minority class [20] and using ensemble learning techniques, training multiple learners on different parts of the training set to artificially increase the importance of observations from the minority class [21].”
